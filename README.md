## Game Play

- The game starts with 
  - **2 players** and 
  - an **empty board**
- The tiles are placed **one at a time**
- The players can only replace **one tile at a time**
- Draw a tile to bring your deck again to 6

## Placing a Tile

- A line is either all one shape or all one colour.
- There are no duplicates in a line.
- Tiles that are added to a line must share the same attribute as the tiles that are already in that line.
- The tiles you play must touch (side to side) a tile that has already been played and match the tile in color or shape.
- Any tiles that touch each other are part of a line.

### Examples

A blue square and a yellow square can be added to create a line of squares.

As the game progresses, spaces will be created where no tile can be played.

## Scoring

When you create a line, you score one point for each tile in that line.

When a tile is part of two different lines, it will score 2 points.

### Qwirkle Bonus

A player gets a bonus 6 points whenever they complete a line of 6 tiles.

This is called a **Qwirkle**.

If a player receives a **Qwirkle**, a message, **"QWIRKLE!!!"**, will be displayed

The game board is displayed after this message.

The first player who uses all of his tiles ends the game and gets a **6 points bonus**.

The player with the **highest score is the winner** of the game.
